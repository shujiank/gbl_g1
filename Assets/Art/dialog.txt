Imagine a linear transformation in Cartesian coordinate system
In the direction along the line y=-3x,the transformation stretches all point by a factor of two.
In the direction along the line y=x, the transformation keeps all point fixed. As shown in figure on the left.
If this transformation is applied to the figure on right what will happen ?
