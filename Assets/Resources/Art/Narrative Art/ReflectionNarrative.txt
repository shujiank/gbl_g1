Archbishop Neo: Hail your highness, we meet again! Having learned the art of transformations, you must use your wits to overcome the next barrier. Let us get you enlightened a bit more.
Sith Lord: Let us move on to a specific form of transformation - Reflections.
Lord of light: I have a feeling that it is supposed to be the mirror image of a vector, as the name suggests.
Khal Drogo: I agree with that.
Sith Lord: You are correct. Let us consider a scenario with a unit square matrix, having (x, y) coordinates as (1, 0) and (0, 1), positioned in front of a mirror placed facing the x-axis, what do you expect to see in the mirror? {show the unit matrix}
Khal Drogo: I am thinking it will convert the vector [x \n y] to [-x \n -y]?
Sith Lord: Think about it! You should also consider the fact that the reflection is along the x-axis.
Lord of light: Oh! I think the vector would be converted to [x \n -y]. So the transformation matrix should be [1 0 \n 0 -1] {Show reflectionX-axis solution}
Sith Lord: Correct! Now what would happen if we applied transformation [0 1 \n 1 0] on the unit matrix?
Khal Drogo: That should be a reflection along the line x = y. {Show reflectionYX solution}
Sith Lord: Well done!
White weirwood trees: Interesting! I'm noticing that these reflection transformations, like [1 0 \n 0 -1] and [0 1 \n 1 0], are equal to their own inverses.
Sith Lord: Good observation! That is one major property of reflection - Every reflection is its own inverse.
Archbishop Neo: Now, Vectoria, your next obstacle entails solving a similar problem.
Archbishop Neo: What transformation has to be applied on the unit matrix for reflection through the line y = -x? {open the puzzle} {solution: [0 -1\n -1 0] (reflectionY-X.png)}
