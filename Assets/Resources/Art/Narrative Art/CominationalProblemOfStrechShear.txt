Sith Lord: How does a blacksmith convert a iron cube into any shape he want. 
Lord of light: He first make the iron mallable by heating it, in the furnace and then apply force to change the shape.
Sith Lord: Good answer, now suppose you have have unit square matrix with  at [0 1] and [1 1]. And you first apply a stretch of [2 0\n 0 1] and then a  shear of [1 0\n 2 1]  . What will happen ?
Lord of light: The first matrix will enlarge the matrix in x axis and the second matrix will apply a shear of 2 unit in the positive y axis.  
White weirwood trees: I also thinks that if we change the order of these transformation matrix the result will remain the same. 
Khal Drogo: I think this transformation make the matrix look like this{ShearStreach.png}
Sith Lord: Impressive works!
Archbishop Neo: So Vectoria, What transformation has to be applied on the unit matrix to make it twice as large in both positive y and x axis and have a shear of 2 unit in x direction a unit ?{open the puzzle} {solution: [2 2\n 0 2] (SolutionOfStrechAndShear.png)}k
