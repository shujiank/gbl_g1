Sith Lord: What if we compress an object along a surface?
Lord of light: It should map the object to the surface.
Khal Drogo: Basically, it will be a projection from 2-space onto the line, that forgets the y-coordinate.
Sith Lord: Good job. This is called a linear projection. Now, if we have a unit matrix that is being projected to the x axis, what do you think will the transformation matrix be like?
White weirwood trees: I believe each vector in the matrix should be projected on the x-axis for the mapping to work.
Khal Drogo: That would make the projection [1 0 \n 0 0] {Show projectionXaxis solution}
Sith Lord: You people are impressive!
Archbishop Neo: So Vectoria, What transformation has to be applied on the unit matrix for projection on y-axis?{open the puzzle} {solution: [0 0\n 0 1] (projectionYaxis.png)}
