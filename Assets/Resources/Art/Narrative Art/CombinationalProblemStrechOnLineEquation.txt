Sith Lord: So far we have seen stretch direction either towards or away from Y axis or X axis. What will happen to this shape {open ProblemCombinationalProblemStrechOnLineEquation.png} when I say that all the point along y=-3 is a stretch by the factor of 2 and the point that are on y=x remain fixed.
Lord of light: I think the point such as (2,2) and (-2,2) will remain fixed as they are on the line y=x. But I am confused about the y=-3x and how it will affect the shape. I know that point satisfying the equation will move 2 unit but I am not sure.
Khal Drogo: I think the point that satisfying the equation y=-3x and line parallel to the equation have a stretch of 2 units.
Sith Lord: Both of you are right. This will result in a new grid. {open ProblemCombinationalProblemStrechOnLineEquationGrid.png}
Sith Lord: Can someone tell me stretch matrix for this problem. I will give you a hint. Consider A as the transformation matrix [a b\n c d] this matrix when multiplied with any point should yield the new stretch point.
White weirwood trees: This means when I apply A[2 /n 2]=[2 \n 2] and A[-1 /n 3]=[-3 \n 6]. By solving I found out A=[5/4 -1/4 \n -3/4 7/4]
Sith Lord: Superb !!!
Archbishop Neo: Now, Vectoria, your next obstacle entails solving a similar problem. What will happen to unit at origin when point at y=x remain fixed and point at y=-x are stretch by the factor of 2.What would be the transformation matrix ?? {solution A=[3/2 -1/2 \n -1/3 3/2]}
